To compile P-Eiffel

jj_dev:  location of various EiffelStudio sources downloaded from SVN or GIT
	-- jj_dev


1.  Download the eiffel development files to home/jj_dev/18.07_dev:
	a.  directory "18.07_dev" should not exist yet.
	b.  this becomes the EIFFEL_DEV directory

cd ~/jj_eiffel
git clone https://github.com/EiffelSoftware/EiffelStudio.git 18.07_dev

Modify .gitattributes to comment out the line * text=auto
	-- Why?  I don't remember.



2.  Fix the two gobo files located at $EIFFEL_DEV/Src/library/gobo (not required for 18.07)
		a.  gobo_xml.ecf
		b.  gobo_utility.ecf:
delete the line:
<cluster name="override_generated" location="override\generated\library\xml\" recursive="true"/>



3.  Apply the persistence patch to the development version
	a.  cd $EIFFEL_DEV/Src
	b.  patch -p0 < /Users/jjj/jj_dev/auto_persistence_20_05.patch


4.  Download Eiffel GPL distribution to home/jj_eiffel/Eiffel_18.07  (or ...Eiffel_20.05)
	a.  $EIFFEL_PURE = variable name in batch files
	b.  For compiling the compiler
	c.  Must be compatible with the development version


5.  Copy files in step 4 to a $JJ_EIFFEL/P_Eiffel
	a.  $P_EIFFEL = variable name in batch files
	a.  This will become the P-Eiffel distribution after the batch file overwrites some files


6.  Run ./build_PEiffel script


7.  Run P-Eiffel using script "P_Eiffel"
	a.  This sets environment variables, etc
	b.  then calls ec -gui  on the P-Eiffel executable version of Studio
